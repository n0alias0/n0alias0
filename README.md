welcome , user
- I been on a computer since Before Y2K probablly as soon as i could figure out how to get in, I been addicted ever since. Not really a choice, not sure why its allowed.
-  and you think it be easy to spread your skill with just knowing how could it work without me. cause i guess most never left social media for why they have any need for pc, just phone,
-  i see. I really didn't see what college was teaching me for computer engineering as adng anything I didn't already knew was going backwards, leaving lower level language\
-  
- well enough with what was useful in the end, just teaching myself was  enough. as one dude that was disappointed c++ had made transistion to java from c++ at the college. 
- I now live in a town too small to find work with what computers - anyway, not adapted for much else, I made a game just to put on google playstore for a start, no its not doing well, 
- then i went further and figured it needed to be better, and for windows pc this time, but im sure that
- will be a nightmare. not to mention you have to be, not an individual, so cool 1000th buisness with flashlite app, i did use unity as easiest thing for games right now.  
- Doesnt feel i did all i knew it should of taken, then
- I got over it. google is no help other than i dont get why unity was made free. it is google's development software colaborated with visual studio that i thought be more popular.
- - I would have expected like any support, but all in all, to be glad that i got to know plenty of tips and info from these websites but I never had time, or a reason to offer help or ask too much
- - Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in Ghheneral. I stopped asking questions when it stopped working, cause, it did. dont even check. Not sure where allthings useful went. unknown 800700 why.
- went used to write the reviews for what an advertisement was saying that would be shown to me, "known to be exageration, till i relize where to g0, this place signs me in to accounts so cool
- ðŸ“« n0alias@outlook.com   yeah i stole it from the exaample in outlook. since, all mine usually did that. and from first email,turned into  all spam, and spam have contacts of well, perfect how it set it up on own. 
- spam i didnt see ever with the forward email option i left home with it long time till 5 years later, i went back to see , but i couldnt see it if i did sign in. it won. not to use. 
- someone kno why unlinkinking it did more than i bargained for. i dont know  what for. Hide the fact they never sent email to forward address that explained the blocking, and other servers that could download emails.
- why skip win 9? forget bout hotmail? 
- just.comon guy. do u kno how big of a prob it was when i used the emaail and didnt kno this. i never got contacted when most importantly, still was bein sent to anyone that email me.
-  sure, butexchange server shows all there deleted... I dont like google andriod windows explorer Loook and app store only. who are they writing this for, me to buy. N0.
  My big project was just one project over time writing my own explorer to use, as i casually would notice i cant find what i need very fast, to some, finding 1 program was the journey. congrats, now u can google somethin.
  didnt worry bout new op systm or transfering pcs,
  desktop changing, files different spotme. every thing is the same. but different. so my own sys32 folder  of tools, and special riht click and wat not, that led to 40 in 1 programs.
  other than duh. i never stop 1st program testing. just like windows. wat i dirty underhanded trik.
<!-
n0alias0/n0alias0 is a âœ¨ special ?âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. thats it, that is not special. i would think that is clever tho
I pput all my effort on these things, i forget to use account.
